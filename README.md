# Junos automation with Saltstack

SaltStack supports Junos automation with a Junos proxy: 
- it provides [execution modules for junos](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.junos.html) and [state modules for junos](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.junos.html)
- Junos proxy controls junos devices without installing salt on device. There is no salt-minion.  
- It uses Junos API: junos-eznc python library (pyez) and netconf.  
- Junos facts are stored in grains.  

Apart from that there is a junos syslog engine: 
 - listens to syslog events 
 - extracts event information 
 - sends it on the master/minion event bus.
 - Control the type of events to be sent.
 - Salt reactors has the ability to take actions according to these events (event driven automation).

Salt supports also Napalm (Network Automation and Programmability Abstraction Layer with Multivendor support). So you can also use it to automate Junos.  

# SaltStack versions: 
Nitrogen has a better network automation support than Carbon.   
https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/releases/version_numbers.html  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chemical_elements  

# SaltStack installation: 
Nitrogen should be available on pypi https://pypi.python.org/pypi by July 2017. 
At that time you will be able to install Nitrogen using
```
# pip install salt
```
Meanwhile, you can install Nitrogen from the salt github repository (https://github.com/saltstack/salt) using the git branch 2017.7:  
```
# pip install git+https://github.com/saltstack/salt.git@2017.7
```
```
# salt --version
salt 2017.7.0-202-g3c8dee0 (Nitrogen)
```

# SaltStack files Structure: 

## salt master: 

The salt-master is configured via the master configuration file: https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html  
The configuration file for the salt-master is located at ```/etc/salt/master``` by default. 

### file_roots: 
Salt runs a file server to deliver files to minions.  
This file server is built into the master daemon and does not require a dedicated port.  
Default location is ```/srv/pillar```.  
Configured via the ```file_roots``` option inside the master configuration file.  

### pillar: 
The default location for the pillar is in ```/srv/pillar```.  
The pillar location can be configured via the ```pillar_roots``` option inside the master configuration file. 
sls files.  
the pillar has a top file. 

### state files: 
SLS (SaLtÂ State) files.  
yaml format.  
representation/description of the state in which a system should be in.   
kind of ansible playbooks.  

## salt-minion:  
the salt-minion is configured via the minion configuration file.
By default, the salt-minion configuration will be in ```/etc/salt/minion```.

## salt-proxy:  
Proxy minions can now be configured in ```/etc/salt/proxy``` or ```/etc/salt/proxy.d``` instead of just pillar. 
Configuration format is the same as it would be in pillar.

## Reactor:  
Reactor sls files should be placed in the ```/srv/reactor/``` directory for consistency between environments, but this is not currently enforced by Salt.
Reactor sls files follow a similar format to other sls files in Salt.  
Reactor SLS files are mapped to event in the master conf file ```/etc/salt/master``` or ```/etc/salt/master.d/reactor.conf```
support for ```salt://``` file paths.
